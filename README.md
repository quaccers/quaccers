- 👋 Hi, I’m @quaccers ☺️ 
- 💻 I’m interested in development in general, but looking to finally settle and hopefully specialize as a game dev ☺️😬
- 🎓 I'm currently developing a game in Godot using GDScript (for ease and compatibility), but want to move onto C# once I've met some targets in GDScript.
- ✌️ I hope to meet some of you soon! A collab would be pretty fun ☺️
- 🌱 I'm quite new to a lot of this, so wish me luck plz 😅
